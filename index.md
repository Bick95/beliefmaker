## Welcome to beliefmaker!

### Foreword

**This is the Project Site for Final Project in Logical Aspects of Multi-Agent Systems (LAMAS@[UG](https://www.rug.nl/)) in 2019/2020.**

This website contains the documentation accompanying the [online tool](http://bick95.pythonanywhere.com/) developed as the final project for the LAMAS course.

## Introduction 

### Philosophical Background

In contemporary philosophy, „belief“ usually refers to an attitude, in which we regard a proposition as true (Schwitzgebel, 2019). While in the English use of the term, a sense of uncertainty may be intended (i.e. „I believe this is the right address“ as meaning „I am not completely sure, if this is the right address“), there is no uncertainty in the agent, when we speak about belief in a philosophical sense. Here, „X beliefs that Y“ can be read as „X takes Y to be true“. Therefore, belief in the philosophical sense, takes knowledge as its aim, and, while in logic we can formally distinguish between knowledge and belief, this distinction is usually hard to make in everyday life (Gettier, 196). All humans constantly carry a set of beliefs, which mostly are implicit, and range in variety from mundane (i.e. the belief to possess hands) to impactful (i.e. the belief that I love my wife), to potentially dangerous (i.e. the belief in homophobic stereotypes). 

### Belief and Conspiracy Theory in Reality

One belief/set of beliefs that can bear great relevance or potential danger, are conspiracy theories. While conspiracy theories themselves possess a great range of variation (i.e. distinction between political and non-political (Räikkä, 2009), or alternative explanation and denial (Huneman & Vorms, 2018)), recent events such the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand, or the Hanau shooting in Germany, unambiguously show, where the belief in conspiracy theories, at its worst, can lead to. Even more recently, conspiracy theories concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, have let people to disobey social distancing guidelines or quarantine rules, thereby potentially putting the life of others at risk. 
    
While there are many possible explanations for the viral spread of conspiracy theories concerning COVID-19 (i.e. scientific norms surrounding peer-reviews and retractions not being able to keep up with the spread of false information (O’Connor & Weaterall, 2020)), we propose that shrinking social circles can be another reason. By shrinking social circles, we describe a process, in which an individual who has a certain belief (i.e. in a conspiracy theory), may cut ties with contacts in their social network, who do not share their belief. By such a process, the individual runs the danger of simply cutting out people with contrasting opinions, leaving them only with those, who also believe in the theory. This could then lead that person to perceive a distorted form of reality, in which the theory is commonly believed, and therefore lead to the false conclusion that the conspiracy is commonly known to be true (recall that informally, believers in a theory cannot distinguish belief from knowledge), which is an even stronger claim.
     
### The Project

The goal of our project beliefmaker, is to use the logic language KD45, in order to show via a visualization in Kripke models, how the removal of agents (meaning accessibility relations within the model), can lead a proposition to become common belief, in the logical sense. After providing some formal logical background concerning KD45 and common belief specifically, we introduce our model and online tool. Then, we will give a concrete example, related to the conspiracy theory that 5G internet towers cause coronavirus infection, of how the model works in practice. Lastly, we will discuss limitations and possible philosophical implications of our model.
